Who still cares about human art ?,"I do! Actually playing around with Dalle-2 and Stable Difussion made me appreciate human art even more.

Who still cares about human art ?,"Agreed. Art is supposed to be an human expression. What people is calling 'AI art' is in fact an  automated image generation, and by the way, it already existed even before computers. As much as we can appreciate an AI generated picture, it is no different from a randomly generated image, the only dofference now is within the complexity of thw algorithms used to make it.",08/09/2022 15:42,0
Who still cares about human art ?,"I thought the purpose of art is to express something that cannot be expressed, make people think, make them feel and move in a different way. This means that venturing and making art that can get tremendously popular later but for that contemporary time, it might be a unpopular opinion or truth that people might run away from. In short, courage to stand out or create a revolution.

Now AI can do well only with what most part of the training data looks like...
& to generate a art that stands out or extremely meaningful, we have to spend rigorous efforts to tune .

So i think art is best with human hands. If i am a nerd and i dont have money for making good posters(also no interest in making one) , only then i think this will be helpful for me.",08/09/2022 20:50,1
Who still cares about human art ?,"As a wise man once said: Art is the one thing the Ai won't be ever able to surpass humans. Do you know why? Because an Ai that is programmed to give you the most of some feelings, will hijack your mind and sense's to do this, while an artist's work let you enter his/her mind and see the feelings and ideas it produces.

Who still cares about human art ?,"Came to say this too. While these tools are incredible in what they can achieve so far, without past works as inputs, they'd create essentially nothing. 

I do think things like stock art and photography and even some graphic design will be replaced eventually. But some humans will always want the story behind the work. To know and connect to the artist as a person. To admire or hate or ponder. Machines may eventually become indistinguishable from us, given enough time, but I somehow doubt humanity will be around that long.",09/09/2022 02:41,0

Who still cares about human art ?,"Well, I guess you're confusing art and craft. I know it is common in the English American language/culture to not distinguish the two, but art is not drawing, painting, or sculpting. 

It is like saying that ""music is a piano"". If you consider art like an esthetic or technical performance, then let me suggest that you're then just at the very beginning of your journey with the appreciation of art.

You're also making a confusion between a tool and a process. 

And in the end, I will always be more moved by a somehow ""imperfect"" (which is a very immature notion) piece of art made by a human that took time to study technics and himself (the hardest things to learn actually), and that decided to share it with me, rather than something made by a chip.

Btw, I work in the Deep Learning / Machine Learning industry and I'm a musician and composer. I'm saying that to precise that I have a foot in both world and that I'm not too biased towards one or the other.


Edit: precision in the second sentence.",08/09/2022 14:48,0
Who still cares about human art ?,"I got your point but I personally think the majority of people don't care about the technics behind a piece of art. Only about the feelings it triggers on them.

Aren't you concerned about that?",08/09/2022 15:39,0
Who still cares about human art ?,"Illustration is not art and there is zero discussion about that. Boundaries are blurry ofcourse, but art is about more than your feels.

AI may eat up a lot of illustrating jobs, but the technology is not there yet. It is way to unprecise and vague. You can use the generated images for inhouse usage, like moodboards or brainstorming, but not much else. Ofcourse, the speed at which this tech is evolving is staggering, but high resolution in combination with precision is a doorstopper (for now).

However, Illustration is not art. The confusion between the two is one of the reasons for all this nonsense debate from illustrators who mistake themselves for artists, while they are drawing the nth iteration of fantasy dragons trending on artstation in the style of greg rutkowski. These people looking down on people who navigate latent space to discover interesting (or just beautiful) locations is hilarious and depressing at the same time.

Actual artists will either incorporate the tech to make interesting stuff that speaks about the worls we live in or not need it alltogether and Illustrators will have to try harder to make a buck. Also, pretentious pricks who think they can call themselves artists while being merely technicians will have a hard time fooling others.

All of these are good things. The only thing I'm worried here is that craft and skill is necessary to develop a trained eye necessary to jump from craft to art and I'm not sure about the path this technology is paving.  But we will find a way.

Anyways, Illustration is not art and that distinction is important.",08/09/2022 17:42,1

Who still cares about human art ?,"My 2cents,

It seems the central issue, if you really dig down, is a question around what makes us special as humans. Never is a long time and I suspect the advances in AI will continue to push us to answer this question. What makes us special? That we have feelings and emotions? I suspect like the touring test, soon we will not be able to distinguish between a construct and a human. Creativity? As a designer, I also draw on my collection of learned experiences to produce something unique. I would argue that if i had the works of all the great works of art (ok maybe just a database of all the paintings humans have made) and I could actually hold them in my mind, I might discover new insights. Yes we are complex and have layers on layers of chemical interactions and reactions.  But complexity does not denote what we believe is alive. We consider the simplest single cell organizing to be “alive”, but the most complex human like construct to not be.  Hmmmm.  AI is not there yet, but it’s growth does seem exponential.  So, the important question is not whether AI will eventually gain more human like abilities, but why do we care?  What makes us so special?  I for one, would encourage those in the field of AI to consider writing the algorithm of empathy.  
Kids eventually grow up, and often  reflect the ideas of their parents.

AI is giving me an existential crisis,"I wouldn't view it that way.

Inequity is a huge problem and has been worsening for decades. What was 'within reach' even thirty years ago compared to today is wildly different. 

If you're in Film/TV, possibly you're a union member. The unions (at least in LA) have done a great job at keeping those jobs viable - but meanwhile people outside of union work have been crushed. In a sense, you were digging those people's graves as well. When a union grip can afford to buy a $500k house but a customer service rep can't afford to rent a tiny apartment, that's a sad statement but it is the state of the world. It's not 'digging their graves', other than in the loosest sense of the term.

My rambling point is that you can reposition yourself and do what you can to still remain viable, without feeling guilty for doing so. At the same time, you can (as you mention) advocate for things that will lower inequity. Not sure 'regulation' will do that, as that will just keep the status quo which may be fine for you, but is awful for many. We need better social safety nets, possibly some form of UBI, health care for all, a more fair justice system, etc. (Mostly speaking of the USA, but some of that is applicable everywhere.)

I'm not sure the current world order is sustainable even without AI, and I'm not sure if AI will improve or worsen things. The idea that regulation holding it back is a good thing is only usually pushed by those in currently comfortable positions.

The prompt driven driven methods of using AI currently only receive very delayed and basic feedback from humans. We haven't yet seen complex generative AI that iterates and shapes engagement rapidly based on direct bio/behavioral feedback.

When that stats, it's game over. Human media will be pointless, because the experiences generated with AI will be better than the best orgazam, the best movie, the best food a person ever had... 

In the same way that social media shapes algorithms to adict users to routines and content, now the content itself will be optimized to illicit the maximum response.

Very soon media will be unrecognizable to what it is today. Addictive patterns, sound and sensory experiences we would have a hard time envisioning today. 

I can't see any way it can be avoided. I believe we will see people sink away into seemingly abstract, but highly optimized technology experiences, and find it very difficult to find enough stimulation outside of this personally calibrated AI engagement.

Ultimately, it's not gaming, it's not porn, it's not movies, or music. Humans can't help to create these experiences, they unconsciously shape them. There is no way to understand currently what it will look or feel like.

AI is giving me an existential crisis,"Here’s how I’ve been thinking about it :

- humans care about things that they know are made by other humans. A silly example but if you press the ‘demo’ key on a keyboard and it plays a perfect tune (obviously not AI, just pre-programmed) - it’s nice but nobody is wowed by it…

…but if a human comes along and plays the exact same piece perfectly in front of you, everybody is wowed by it. The fact that a human did it matters.

- yes this is going to democratise access, much like YouTube’s emergence did - suddenly every Jack and Sally could make video with a DSLR, hell a whole new industry of ‘Youtuber’ content emerged and got massive. It took market share from the entertainment market but it didn’t kill it, it just opened it up.

- I’m watching all the Runway releases and they’re cool but I’m also sick of the amount of generated content already. The true artists will use it with their craft to tell stories in a unique way that everyone else isn’t, that’s always the usp. 

- the next decade is going to be absolutely wild but humans look to other humans to navigate it and it matters what they do. ChatGPT could already write a million novels but has it destroyed storytelling? No. 

Just my 2 cents. I hear you, also went through the existential dread and now feel like I’m out the otherside for the moment.

Being able to craft a narrative about your AI content may become important. There are people doing interesting things with AI, and people doing boring stuff.

The fact you can't put every emotion into words or that it's no use of telling an AI every single placement of elements in your image compared to learning how to draw yourself means creativity and expression will always be valued.

It takes an artist to know what colors and shapes he wants to use to express his ideas. An author to know if a story has a good pace and writting. Sure people can align 20 words describing the movie what they want, but AI will also output the most generic piece of media imaginable to fit those.

In all honesty, I want the CEOs to get replaced BECAUSE of this behavior. But whether AI is the one to do it, well that I think is a bit unrealistic and dystopian.

I believe a future exists where both kinds of artists can exist. I know you don't see a prompt creator as an artist, but there is nuance and skill to truly create something beautiful from generic dribble that AI will spit out if you fail to understand how to engineer the writing of the prompt, the type and scope of modeling the inferred data, etc. Like anything, it's a skill that someone such as yourself probably already has an advantage over most others because you understand what works on paper, and what sells in theaters. The opportunity for collaboration is out there and its enormous.

I personally see AI (in its many forms) in two ways, you can either see it for what it is, a tool, or you can advocate against it and become obsolete. There will ALWAYS be a need for classic artists/writers/acting/voice talent. People see movies with their favorite actors/directors, etc. I do not see this changing.

And then there is how the entertainment industry has ALWAYS been the upstart, the disruptor, the innovator. This is the next revolution.

Video killed the radio star, yet we still have radio. The production of Jurassic Park is yet an other example. The power struggle that took place because practical effects were being replaced with CGI and there ended up being this beautiful marriage between the old-school practical effects and modern tools. Puppeteers who feared of losing their jobs to Graphic VFX artists ended up being the key to solving animation limitations. Movies are still made with practical effects, the best kinds are in fact. Skills can be transferred or new skills can be learned.

The same can be said for Piracy, the industry simply had to adapt to accomodate the needs of the consumer. Sure, it still exists, but not nearly at the rate as it did and it's not because you can't easily find your favorite show or movie on a torrenting site, but because there now exists a platform that competes with these free offerings but adds VALUE to why you would spend the extra on a monthly subscription.

History is simply repeating. We all just need to adapt and stop watching Terminator movies with the fear they are coming for us all. It's gonna be better at the end of the day. There is always a moment of confusion or fear of the unknown, but given time, innovators, creators and problem solvers are bred out of conflict and society moves forward better for it.

AI is giving me an existential crisis,"The Amount of Logical Fallacies I keep seeing in all of the arguments and cries of those scared of AI creation is very telling. AI is a tool; a tool created by humans to assist and enhance our capabilities, not replace them. It is not an inherent threat to be feared, but rather a technology that we can control and direct. Can and will people abuse or misuse this tool? Of course; but that's what mastering a craft is all about: learning how to best use your tools of your trade to succeed.

You're weakening your argument with the following logical fallacies:

&#x200B;

1. **Appeal to Fear (i.e. ""Fearmongering"")**: You're using fear-based rhetoric to persuade the audience. While it's essential to address the potential impact of AI on jobs, presenting a worst-case scenario without concrete evidence or counterarguments can be misleading and unnecessarily alarming. I respect that you're afraid, but fearmongering is a poor method of persuasion and not logically sound.
2. **Hasty Generalization**: You're also making sweeping generalizations about the consequences of AI advancements without offering specific data or a nuanced assessment of the situation. It's crucial to consider various factors and potential benefits that AI can bring alongside challenges, and you have the burden of proof to provide cogent evidence to back your claims up.
3. **Ad Hominem**: You're suggesting that AI proponents and similar creatives that utilize AI tools have delusions and insulting beliefs about their achievements. It's more productive to engage with their arguments and evidence rather than attacking their character or intentions. There are many people who use different forms of technology to create art in all its forms; to claim that unless a creative work is entirely the product of an individual's skill and effort it lacks authenticity or value is some form of authenticity fallacy (Possibly No True Scotsman or Appeal to Tradition).
4. **Slippery Slope**: You paint a grim picture of the future, predicting a series of devastation triggered by AI advancements, such as job loss and economic collapse. Such predictions often oversimplify complex issues and ignore potential solutions and adaptations. Fearmongering and Slippery Slope often go hand in hand, so it's not surprising to see it, but it needs to be addressed nonetheless.
5. **""Cherry-Picking"" (i.e Selective Quotation)**: You selectively quoted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's statement of ""It is different"" without providing the full context; namely that Altman was claiming that OpenAI and similar technology is not social media. It's essential to consider the complete statement to accurately understand Altman's position and its implications. His quote does not support your fearmongering, slippery slope statement; and to take it out of context as such looks really bad.

&#x200B;

Your original statement about AI raises valid concerns, but it's vital to recognize and address the logical fallacies within it.  While there are potential challenges associated with AI, it's crucial to avoid fear-based rhetoric and sweeping generalizations. As I said above, AI is a tool, made by humans, designed with specific purposes in mind. It is not inherently threatening, as it lacks consciousness and intentions. Rather, AI serves as a means to enhance our capabilities, automate repetitive tasks, and provide valuable insights to assist in decision-making and brainstorming.

&#x200B;

Responsible development and ethical considerations can guide a positive impact on society, and there are multiple similar technological innovations that have occurred through human culture that we have both adapted to as people and as workers. Digital Audio Workstations  revolutionized music production by enabling artists to compose, record, and produce music entirely on a computer. This technology democratized music production but also led to similar scared discussions about the impact on recording studios and production in the music industry. The concept of digital art (not even AI art) has damn near created a schism in the art world, with some making similar Ad Hominem statements about those who use digital art tools are ""not real artists,"" but there are also hundreds, if not millions, of new artists and art pieces being created thanks to the technological innovations and availability that digital art brings.

&#x200B;

I see a traditionalist who takes pride in the art they make, and they see a threat that will damage not just their pride, but their livelihood. But that's how innovation works: you can adapt to the changes or you may suffer the consequences of rigidity. There will almost certainly always be a market for handmade, human-created content; it may lessen due to new innovations, but there will still be a demand. People still do blacksmithing, people still use horses as a mode of transportation, and (more importantly for this debate) people still highly value traditional art in all its forms. But don't discredit and devalue AI technology through fearmongering and appeals to tradition based on your own fears and insecurities.

While the commenter makes some fair critiques of logical fallacies, their argument also contains flaws.

Firstly, dismissing concerns about AI as mere ""fearmongering"" is an oversimplification. There are legitimate worries about the societal impacts of rapidly advancing AI technologies that deserve thorough discussion, not blanket dismissal.

Secondly, while selective quotation of Sam Altman is a valid critique, one quote does not invalidate the broader concerns being raised. There are many experts beyond Altman voicing apprehension about AI's potential disruption of the economy and jobs.

Thirdly, the analogy to previous innovations like digital audio workstations is overly simplistic. The pace and scale of advancement in AI pose uniquely disruptive potential. Past adaptation to technology does not guarantee smooth adaptation this time.

Fourthly, while some ""no true Scotsman"" elitism about art may exist, economic worries about automation are not just about injured pride. Livelihoods are at stake for many.

Fifthly, claiming AI ""lacks consciousness and intentions"" ignores possibilities of advanced AI surpassing human capacities. We cannot confidently claim we will always be able to control AI tools we create.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, while the original post has flaws, so does dismissing all AI concerns as illogical fearmongering. This complex issue requires nuanced analysis, not binary reductionism.

You likely (your industry definitely) didn't care when automation through robotics and machine learning killed others jobs, cashiers, stockers, taxi drivers, manufacturing etc. This isn't a new trend, and yet you want everyone to pause now because it is now affecting you. 

Creativity is not restricted to those fortunate enough to attend fine arts schools and get a background in painting, animation etc. AI is simply lowering the barriers in translating what someone's imagination is into reality. Just as the camera killed portrait painting it invented surrealism and all kinds of new conceptual art. This too will happen with AI, art will change and be redefined. What will be challenged is the barrier of entry and the skills required to create and the skills required to monetize those skills.

Now that's out of the way, consider what all those jobs do to the tax base when those salaries are no longer paid.

Not only are people losing the ability to feed their families, but governments are losing their budgets to keep social services alive.

Software like [Blue Prism](https://www.blueprism.com/) in the hands of a small team can upend jobs that largely involve pushing paper and dragging a mouse across the screen.

This is not a new problem, only now it's enroaching on creatives.

You are correct to be concerned, and it's good to see people starting to notice but this has been happening since the assembly line.

Where we'll disagree is that I don't believe we need to protect jobs.  We need to protect people's ability to live, and for every job that's displaced a human, equal social services should be supported by the gains that end up out of the hands of the worker and the government taxes, into some earnings report controlled by a team of shareholders sitting in an ivory tower for quarterly board meetings.

AI is giving me an existential crisis,"Relax. I think you've psyched yourself out by overthinking, which is easy to do for someone like me with generalized anxiety. I work in media as well, so we're similar in that regard. However, I'm not that concerned at the moment about AI taking over for humans. There are a few niche areas where AI is really useful, and it can be useful to a degree in the creative fields. I use ChatGPT to help me with social captions, or help me brainstorm a graphic, for example. 

The thing is, for all the hype, AI still kind of sucks. It's like a band that creates a one-hit-wonder and all their other songs are pretty lame. Even with OpenAI's plugin store that can expand the capabilities of ChatGPT, the general consensus is it's...meh. There might be a few very niche things the plugins can do to outperform humans, but the AI is mostly still inferior.

It lacks the human element of soul, intelligence, logic, and creativity. It can do rote things faster, but I find ChatGPT to be really dumb a lot of the time. I'll ask it to do something that should be easy, and it completely screws up. 

As for media...the trend on YouTube now is to use AI voiceovers and a ton of B-roll. It's the cheapest and least creative way to make a video, and I hate it. It's still very obvious what's AI generated. The voices tend to lack the warmth of a human, and they mispronounce words constantly. The videos are dull and feel robotic. I worry that the quality of YouTube videos will start to go down as people try to take shortcuts with AI instead of investing time in real content. 

Scripts written by AI often don't make logical sense with their plot. The dialogue can sound very robotic or ridiculous. I think AI can be useful in the initial brainstorming phases of a project, but when it comes to crafting the subsequent stages, a human is still very much required. If Hollywood tried to make a film using nothing but AI, it would be a chaotic disaster. Human reasoning, understanding, and creativity still triumphs - for now. AI is a tool. We're still the master craftsmen. Don't worry so much. 

I'm actually excited at the possibilities of AI in the future as I see the current way of using technology completely changing. It's not that AI will create a script for you - it's that it will do all the tedious work of writing a script for you so you can focus on the creative part. Instead of hunting and pecking for what buttons to click on a GUI, and having to remember how to do a certain thing in an app, you can tell AI to do it for you in a simple sentence, saving you a lot of mental energy. That's where I see AI going. Right now we waste considerable time navigating around a screen, switching apps, learning processes to do what we need to do, having to do things in multiple steps...but AI can eliminate all of that and make our workflows way more efficient. 

The initial glamour of AI showed examples of it doing all of these high level things that only humans have been capable of doing. But I think as time goes on and the market sorts out where AI is most useful, we'll see it implemented in more nuanced ways that are actually practical rather than fanciful. We're barely a year into the AI revolution, so right now much of what we imagine AI to be capable of could very well end up not coming to fruition.",18/09/2023 14:21,0

No. AI is still operated by humans. Skilled artists will get x1000 more from the Stable-Diffusion-assisted pipeline compared to uneducated early adopters. Skilled authors will get x1000 more from the GPT-assisted pipeline compared to hobbyists. 

Moreover, with many more people trying themselves in art or book writing, seasoned experts become super-valuable! Many newly born AI-artists have no idea of color theory, composition, and other important bits. AI does not magically imbue anyone with that knowledge.

I have been using AI (aka neural networks) since the mid-nineties, and it still has a lot of room for improvement. Does it automate and improve the process of industrial art production or text processing? Absolutely! Will it eliminate jobs? Absolutely not. It created a lot of jobs already, and it will add a lot more when technology goes to plateau (hype peak is not there to stay). 

I see that many people see AI as a new ""miracle"". It is not anything close to that. It is an old thing, really. Ask physicists how and when t-quark was discovered, and they will tell you that it was discovered in 1995 using neural networks. That's the AI of 0-generation. Every ten years we see a new generation of AI, but there was no panic or job loss before. There won't be any tomorrow, just trust me here. AI is nothing new. The latest generation got hyped a lot because everyone can see shiny images by Midjourney or use ChatGPT, but that's not a ground-breaking thing. That's just another step of evolution that will go on. Don't worry, this hype will disappear in six months, and AI will be accepted in 12 months.

>  if people get big productivity boost, less peple will be needed to satisfy that demand

It will. Always does so:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle

Fear is the biggest issue here. Scientists and IT folks have no fear because they experienced a gradual improvement of AI over decades. Artists and authors are experiencing a ""shock"", that's true. But that will pass. Humans are highly adaptable, that's how we survived and dominated other species on Earth.

That's what they say every 5-10 years. Did not happen in the past, will not happen in the future. Yes, industrial automation is a thing, but I repeat: it creates more jobs then it destroys. Different kind of jobs, but hey, that is called evolution. Follow the evolution or be extinct. I have no sympathy for dinosaurs, really.

Because they are not following the market. Here is a live example:
1. Game development is booming, because PCs and game dev is extremely accessible now. Tens of thousands of games are published on Steam and on mobile every year. Hundreds of thousands are expected in a few years;
2. I just joined the gamedev as a hobbyist, because it is so easy to do. I wrote a game prototype using my IT skills, and I generated some art using AI. Do you know my problem? AI-generated art does not have consistent style - I mean UI, illustrations, characters - everything. AI has allowed me to experiment with gamedev, but it did not solve my problem of having a cute and consistent art for my game.
3. Now, I do not have millions to spend on art, but I have thousands of USD, and I am ready to spend them today if someone provides me with consistent high-quality art for my game in weeks, not months or years.
4. ""Traditional"" artists are out of luck, they can't give me what I want, and AI is not capable of doing what I really need either. BUT, artists who have traditional art education and experience PLUS know how to use AI can satisfy my needs in weeks, and they get my money. This is a completely new source of income for artists, and the demand is HUGE.

> you can think of AI as you expert coworker or competitor which is much faster and efficient than you and which can work 24/7 for close to no pay

Never. Do you know why? Because competition. Every time you hear AI there will be a real human behind, just to stay competitive. Also, responsibility. Why would I trust my money to the AI? Ask millionaires if they are willing to pass the control over their money to the AI, and you will get the answer you need. Never. Again, I have been watching AI development for ~30 years, and every few years I hear near-identical pitches of having super-genius AI that will solve all possible issues. This never happened in the past. Today is no different from yesterday, sorry.

You say ""You are not a talented artist and you didn’t make anything by writing a prompt"" - but have you tried it? Some prompts are better than others, and some get better results. Creating the right prompts takes talent. It may not be the kind of talent you are used to, and you may not like or currently respect it, but it is a major type of talent that is emerging. Think about proactively building skills that seem complementary to AI - things like creativity, innovation, design thinking, emotional intelligence, collaboration, and project leadership. These human strengths will likely remain in demand. AI may automate certain tasks, but it also can create new kinds of jobs and opportunities we can't yet envision. History shows technology reshapes work rather than eliminating it. With an open mindset, you may find new creative niches for your skills. Think about what drew you to this film and television originally - the joy of creation, connecting with audiences, technical mastery? AI may change the mediums, but your core motivations can still be fulfilled.

I have been preaching about the coming technological singularity for 40 years, and people did not believe me, or did not care. They still don't. For 30 years I have been saying the technological singularity would happen between 2020 and 2030. For what it is worth I am okay with it even though I have had 40 years to worry about it. One thing to understand is that change will be increasingly rapid and unpredictable. Although we cannot predict what will happen, I have an instinctive feeling this will be the greatest thing that ever happened to people. We humans were on the verge of destroying ourselves and our planet. We have the knowledge and the means to save our environment, and ourselves, but we lack the political will to do what is needed. I hold out hope that these machines will not only come up with even better ways to save the planet, but have the persuasive skills and convince us to do what is right.

You believe we need legislation and we need it yesterday, but what laws? If you make laws to protect jobs, and you overdo it, then you hamstring the advancement of the AIs and the people and companies that use them. I would prefer laws that tax extreme profits, AI generated or otherwise generated, to provide for people's needs and to retrain people to live in the modern world. What is a job anyway - it is wage slavery, you do someone else's bidding with the threat of homelessness and hunger hanging over your head if you do not. Consider focusing less on ""protecting jobs"" and more on protecting people's ability to learn, adapt and access opportunities. With the right social policies, we can make sure no one is left behind in the AI transition.

You believe it is ""too  little, too late."" and, in a sense, so do I, but I am glad of it. By the time Congress, moving at a glacial pace, acts on AI, the AIs will be ten steps ahead, by the time Congress reacts then the AIs will be 100 steps ahead. We will not benefit by ignorant politicians making ill-informed decisions. ""Why isn’t everyone as scared as I am?"" well many of us are not scared because this time has been predicted for over 70 years, it is the inevitable result of evolution. Not point in fearing what you cannot stop. If the dam is going to burst no matter what you do, then get out of the way and seek higher ground. You could try to stomp AI out in the free world, but then it would just arise in China or Russia much more powerful than our own and crush us.

Like let's take a look at movie scripts. Personally I feel like around 90% of what is produced now is hot garbage. Cliches reused thousands of times, gender swaps, race swaps, remakes, stories retold from very slightly different perspective but in less interesting way. Like how many movies STILL use the damsel in distress in cliché or deus ex machina? How many movie plots are based on some random conflict/misunderstanding that can be solved in characters would just actually talk with each other. Interpersonal drama in every tv show ever. Don't get me wrong, it is hard to create something new that's interesting but most of these writers are not even trying.   


I think what the move to AI will do it's gonna really destroy the one's that were cruising on creating low quality product. We still gonna have some directors that will want human writers and creators but it will less and less common.   


Regarding CGI-AI actors and replacing human actors fully, really depends how people will take the on the idea of virtual actor. There is a movie about this actually which is pretty funny: [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258153/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258153/)  


I don't see it happening any soon. But I am sure tech companies are working hard to create something like that. Let's not forget CGI is still damn expensive to do. So till it's cheaper to do it with real people it will stay that way.",17/09/2023 04:49,0
AI is giving me an existential crisis,"As somebody who has been a big proponent of AI likely exceeding humanity in anything worth doing, whose undergrad thesis and first two jobs were in machine learning, and who uses cutting edge AI for work 7 days a week and speaks to the people making them on occasion...

There's so many damn edge cases which are hard to solve, and you're not in as much immediate danger as you think by the looks of things. It can do some things well, and might be good enough for say a monster of even a quick extra in the next year, but right now even for something simple like a person picking up a cup or even just walking at the camera without glitching out everywhere, it's magnitudes easier to just use a real person than get the few people in the world who know how to use AI well to bang their heads against a wall trying to make it work.

Corridor Crew has a few 'anime' videos they made using fairly cutting edge AI, a whole (indie) studio of multiple people working on it as a full time job, and while it's very cool, it's mostly carried by their writing and editing and selection of assets for things like backgrounds, and the AI parts are still incredibly janky in so many ways. The underlying issues don't seem likely to be solved by just throwing more processing power at it, and I've read dozens of major papers in the last year and none seem close to addressing the things that need to be addressed.

Writing seems more likely to be in immediate danger than anything involving footage to me, as somebody who has played with a lot of different machine learning options and finetuned some of my own.",17/09/2023 05:05,0

Life is not a tranquil river; it is subject to change.

Your apprehensions are completely understandable. An increasing number of workers find themselves in your predicament. Our only option is to adapt and seek alternative means of livelihood. Some have chosen to detach from this system and adopt an unconventional lifestyle. This reality has been long foreseen in literary masterpieces and science fiction movies.

AI is giving me an existential crisis,"I’m a data scientist who builds AI for a living.  Last weekend I started writing a short story.  I found myself wondering why I was doing it.  AI could easily generate one with a prompt.  I realized that I didn’t care.  I didn’t want AI to generate any part of MY story.  I suspect many people would feel the same way.  So I think art will diverge into art created for profit, and art created from inspiration.   

AI does not, and never will, understand what it is like to be human.  It can simulate the creations of humans, and even explain them, but it will never understand what it is like to live a human life.  It’s just like me, a man, never being able to understand what it’s like to live life as a woman.  I can empathize and imagine, but I’ll never truly know.  Art is created from understanding, and allows others to have a glimpse into the creator’s experiences and motivations.  AI may be able to create beautiful masterpieces in the likeness of what a human would create, but they are devoid of meaning.  It would be no different than a meandering snail carving out the Mona Lisa in the sand of a beach.  Miraculous, but the snail would be clueless as to what it would have done.   

I think art that comes from experience will always be appreciated more than synthetic art.  People are willing to pay more for organic produce at the grocery store.  Maybe organic art will become a thing.   

Art created for the purpose of profit will undoubtedly descend to the cheapest form of creation.  Hyper-customized, AI generated media is the future.  Your Netflix home screen will one day be generated on the fly, with entirely realistic fake TV shows created just for you when you turn on the screen.  You are right, that it will be difficult or impossible to be paid to produce media in the future.  But everyone will know that AI creations are cheap entertainment, created solely for addiction, and not for expression.   

One day AI might advance enough to be able to generate art from its own unique experiences, and that will truly be something to behold.  But until then, everything AI creates will be empty copies of what humans can make.

AI is giving me an existential crisis,"It's been useful to me to frame it as a ""productivity tool."" 

I remember when Photoshop came out there was a magazine cover of OJ wearing yellow ducky slippers in court - the implication being computers and software have blurred the line between reality and fiction so that its now unrecognizable. 

It's a similar feeling now with the rise of generative ai - how will I know if something is ""authentic?"" Today, its rather commonplace to identify some image as ""photoshopped"" ... but it wasnt easy to imagine that when the tool first became popular. I imagine we'll go through a similar progression with generative ai: start with some kind of shock and amazement, then progressive familiarity, then common knowedge and the ability to discern with some commonly acceptable level of confidence. 

For the jobs lost and replaced by automation ... consider the transition from live action to celophane animation, then to digital animation. Trying to make a motion picture like Disney's Incredibles or Avatar using only the artisan tools available in the 1930s would have required 10x more people on staff and been 100x more expensive - if possible at all. 

Today, we don't bemoan all those people that didnt get a job on Avarar or Incredibles because we used technology and vfx ... instead we celebrate the triumph of cinema's expansion into new frontiers. The films still employ a f*ck-ton of people, though it was probably hard to see how when we reached that technical threshold.

Probably some pain and re-organization in the next 5 to 10 years as we figure out how we intend to use this techology. People will lose their jobs, but I dont think we'll reach a place where there's nothing on the other side.",21/09/2023 16:45,0
How do you think AI will impact Medical Illustration?,"I've had a change of opinion on this the more I dig into it. I've done 2 podcasts about the impact of AI on our industry. [In the first episode](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalillustration/comments/10339kg/medical_illustration_podcast_ai_vs_art/) I was very much responding to the negative backlash on social media of many artists who were really upset to find their work had been used without permission to train AI--some of these folks even had internet trolls going after them for expressing their objections and that's not cool. I still agree with these objections, but I also think there's more going on here. I [followed up with another episode](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalillustration/comments/12b8djs/medical_illustration_podcast_ai_tools/) where I pointed out we really can't avoid this, and moral obligations aside, these tools are undeniably powerful and we absolutely must keep pace.

I would say we all need to start using AI tools as much as possible for a very important reason: you need to know what they can and can't do. If you're more familiar with AI than the client your talking to, you can direct the conversation away from fantasy and vague possibility, and towards what's actually do-able and what value you can provide that AI can't. You have to use AI in order to know that. With VR projects we sometimes find clients will think putting a headset on will inject them into a Matrix-like artificial reality. It's not nearly as immersive as they think. Much the same as VR, with AI, you're going to quickly find that some clients will start asking you to make something for them using a technology they themselves have never used.

I think it's important to know for anyone considering entering the field that even before AI came along, there always has been less ""creative"" art production involved with medical and scientific illustration than you may have thought, depending on what your intial impressions were. A lot of our time as professionals is spent researching, project-managing, and revising the same image/piece many times over. Some people leave the field when they realize they aren't going to be sitting around drawing whatever they feel like. Some people burn out from the norm of constant revisions on every project. It's anything but leisure.

However, if you enjoy researching and trying to problem solve with visuals, then this career could be a great fit for you and I don't think AI will replace that essential part of the job just yet. It's pretty standard these days for most MIs to use 3D software and video production tools. Neither activities involve drawing or painting, but they're powerful tools. AI is just another tool. The people I see generating the most impressive results with AI are folks who I knew could make high-level artwork before these tools became available. The more knowledgeable you are about how to make a compelling image, the more effective you will be with any image-making tool. The more knowledgeable you are about how to communicate a complicated medical or scientific topic, the more effective you will be as a MI regardless of what tools you use.

Moving forward, MIs will be using more AI tools, and so will our clients. We have to be able to talk the talk with them on the same level when it comes to what AI can and can't do. We have to know why it makes sense for them to use AI to accomplish certain goals. Check out [the talk I just posted by Camron Slayden to learn about some of the positive impacts AI will have on our field](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalillustration/comments/13sis7a/bearing_witness_to_the_singularity_presentation/). I strongly recommend you watch this whole presentation including the Q+A at the end. Camron talks a lot about companies that are using AI tools for medical and research objectives, not just art generation, so it's great for learning about how our clients in the future will have new skills and tools at their disposal that we'll need to understand in order to be successful collaborators with them.

The take-home message I'd like you to get is: don't get depressed, get excited. We're entering a new age where everyone, for now, is on similar footing because this is equally new to everyone. People are making art with AI that simply wasn't possible before. People are using AI to create new reasons to hire us that didn't exist before. AI will probably be giving us universal translator capabilities meaning we can connect and work with anyone on the globe without a language barrier anymore, which means more possibilites for collaborations. There are lots of reasons to view AI positively, you just have to want to see them.

Lastly, in regards to recommendations on what else you should do in conjunction with your science illustration degree, I would say think about it less in terms of the subject or topic of the major, and more in terms of what people will that additional education track put you in contact with? Look at your options in terms of what charismatic professors you might be able to study under, or influential academics you might get to meet. Build that social network. The real face-to-face one. AI won't be able to replace that any time soon.",26/05/2023 18:24,0
How do you think AI will impact Medical Illustration?,"Here’s the thing about “AI” as it’s currently implemented: it’s just a really complex mathematical process that takes a lot of examples and produces a similar example given similar inputs. That’s it - a really tough mathematical process.

That means that it can’t produce anything new or original. So the questions are:

Is there enough medical illustrations to sample to produce new ones that stand the chance of surviving a copyright challenge? 

Do you think it’s going to be cheaper to hire someone to explain to the mathematical process how to accurately draw an organ in whatever state the image requires or to hire an artist to draw it?

How do you think AI will impact Medical Illustration?,"I am aiming to get my Masters in Medical Illustration. I have been faced with this question from others quite a bit.

I have a background in the sciences, with a BA in Biology. 

In my own opinion, what you have to do as a medical illustrator can't be taken over by AI, at least right now. You will be illustrating complex medical, scientific, processes and ideas. You have to accurately illustrate this- and having a good understanding scientifically of what is happening.

AI may be able to generate ideas and images, but I don't think it is capable of illustrating complex processes which will require 100% efficacy. One little fault in conveying the scientific info in the illustration will make it incorrect. 

Now, take into account that the field of Medical Illustration is already utilizing AI. But it is not to take away the job, just make it easier for the illustrator. It is currently being used to fill in gaps to cut down time in creating animation, and being used to clean up final pieces.

When will AI replace fiction writers?,"Yeah, for example, it cant handle any real witty nuance.

It can dream up, say, a first-person story of an old retired war veteran retelling a tale of a past deed. 

But it cant handle something like; that war veteran telling a story of courage, but in reality his actions had terrible consequences (that he still remains unaware of) but, by reading between the lines, its implied he actually caused huge problems for his comrades.

It will always just tell you a story, and then say “but then I realised… I hurt everyone” it can’t actually weave it into the telling. It takes a human mind to weave in that intricacy.

Whilst that might improve, I dont think it will ever be fully eliminated. The best creative outputs require creative minds that understand humanity on a human level with a human mind.

It can easily tell a story of cliches, a knight vs a dragon for example, and do very well. But introducing much clever nuance is difficult for it.",23/03/2023 10:29,1
When will AI replace fiction writers?,"As a person who writes hard science fiction about AI and social robots in the near future as a hobby I have given this some thought. So far I've written seven novellas and forty short stories or about fifteen hundred printed pages on the subject. Note that I do not write to get published but as a person who gardens, paints or does free climbing for a hobby. You don’t do it to get rich or famous. The process and personal sense of achievement are all that matters. If a few others share your interest that’s nice too. 

I don’t think your question can be answered in absolute terms. With the recent new product announcements, as Bill Gates recently said, the age of AI has begun. Writers and no doubt science fiction writers are already using them to some degree. Many writers already use these new AI as tools, others will use them to write SF purely to make money via Amazon’s Kindle Publishing Service for example. Others will use them in a way that is genuinely artistic and produce all kinds of works of art, including SF, but I expect such works will have a very mixed reception. There will be philosophical arguments about it and if you know anything about philosophers they never stop arguing. So the issue will never be “settled”.

Allow me to share two pages/chapters (1k words each) from a novella I wrote in 2022 about AI, art and writing.  My intent is simply to share a few of my thoughts about the question you raise. As I said I do not believe it is possible to actually answer your question.

The year is 2275 and the two main characters, Lena and Pippa, are embodied, fully self-aware AI called Companions. The world does not know they are conscious in every sense of the word but believes they are simply highly advanced Artificial *General* Intelligences. They work at an academic institution dedicated to AI.

Eventually we will have models good enough that publishers will prefer to have AI churn out the formulaic types of novels; romance, space opera, short stories, and whatever else can be defined as formulaic.  Eventually humans writers will only be published if they are exceptionally gifted and genre blending and only for as long as it takes to train AI writers on the style.

When will AI replace fiction writers?,"Replace outright: 1-2 years (possibly sooner at the rate the technology's progressing). However, for the time being, a writer is definitely needed to achieve the best results. And, even after AI writers are able to write decent books and screenplays entirely on their own, the quality level is going to be mixed, so the best writers will still have a place for a at least a few more years (especially since their name alone will still sell copies/tickets).

Additionally, not everyone will want to read AI written books, or watch AI written movies, so there will be a market for human written books and screenplays long into the future. The really interesting question then becomes, ""how long will it be before we have true AGI writers with large fan bases of their own (as is already happening with virtual influencers).",25/03/2023 02:21,0
When will AI replace fiction writers?,"But you see, a LLM requires a large body of text to train. And there’s potentially a problem - a high-quality text is significantly smaller in its volume. Like - GPT-3 required 500 billion words. That’s 10000 years of a single person writing at rate 60 words per minute. 

Maybe it’s not the case, but it seems that with the current approach the AI will produce something extremely average at best.",25/03/2023 08:13,0
When will AI replace fiction writers?,"That's a great point. High quality datasets will be key! Hypothetically, if every fiction book in the world were to be scanned, then that collection, along with a cutting-edge foundation model, could be combined to create an extremely powerful AI writer. However, not every book is grade A, so a ratings system would need to be apart of the dataset in order for the AI to learn how to differentiate between the good and the bad.   


In a lot of ways, training an AI is similar to the same training process humans undergo to master a subject, so with better hardware, data, and deep learning techniques the LLMs should continue to improve over time.",25/03/2023 08:37,1

When will AI replace fiction writers?,"I appreciate the thoughtful question. As an author myself, I don't believe [AI will entirely replace gifted human storytellers](https://storychief.io/blog/ai-replace-writers) anytime soon - if ever. 

While tools like GPT-4 Turbo continue to rapidly advance, even the most sophisticated AI still lacks the profound creativity, empathy, imagination and spark of insight that allows the stories I write to resonate emotionally and stand the test of time. Robots remain limited by their training data; human authors draw from a lifetime of diverse experiences and observations of the human condition.

Could AI mimic certain writing techniques? Perhaps. But compelling tales of the human experience, with all their authentic wisdom, wit and subtle social commentary, come from profoundly human qualities machines cannot replicate. 

AI can surely lighten our workload - providing that ethical guardrails are in place, as with [Storychief's writing assistant](https://il.ly/get/storychief). But the most universally beloved, culturally insightful narratives will always require the hand of human creators. I believe readers will continue seeking out the beautiful work of gifted authors, not bots. Our imaginative spirit remains indispensable.",22/11/2023 15:37,0
